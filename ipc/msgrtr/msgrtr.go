	Mnemonic:	msgrtr
	Abstract:	See package doc below.

	Date:		30 Oct 2015
	Author:		E. Scott Daniels

	Mods:		12 Nov 2015 - Added support to accept listener data and include that
					when events are sent out.
				07 Jun 2018 - Correct printf bug.
*/

/*
	Provides a message routing interface.  The user application invokes
	the Start() function to begin listening using http on the given port.
	Messages received are 'unpacked' and then routed to the user application's
	threads.

	The 'url' passed on the start call is the only one which is supported.
	Threads in the application can register and provide a channel on which
	event structures are delivered for matching events.  The registration
	defines the 'path' which match messages (e.g. network/router/add). Paths
	may be 'short' (e.g. network/router) to receive all messages which match
	to that depth.  Multiple listeners can register for the same path; all 
	messages are 'broadcast' to all listeners; there is no concept of 
	bubble up or handling which prevent the event from being delivered to 
	some of the listeners.

	The listening thread can respond (reply) to an event, and at least one
	listener must reply if the ack field is set to true. If no listeners
	reply the sending application will hang until timeout. Only one reply 
	per event is sent, the first, all others are silently discarded. Replys
	are sent by using the event's reply function.

	Event messages are expected to be posted to the url as a json object
	with some known set of fields, and optionally some meta information 
	which the listener(s) may need.   The 'band' field describes the 
	'path' (e.g. network/router) and the action type will be appended to 
	the path provided that the action is not empty or missing.

	When an event is received it is written on the channel of all listeners
	which have registered for the event type.  The contents pushed on the 
	channel is a *msgrtr.Event which has public fields so that they are 
	easily accessed by the user programme. Speifically, the event type
	and paylod are probably what is of the most interest. The payload is
	is a map, indexed by string, which references interface{} elements. 
	The event type is the _complete_ type; not just the portion of the 
	type that the listener registered.  For example, if the listener
	registered network.swtich (wanting all events for network switches)
	the event types generated would include:  network.switch.add, network.switch.del
	network.switch.mod, etc.  If a listener registers only for a specific type,
	then that will be the only type delivered.  

	The third  field of interest, and to which the user process must pay attention
	to, is the Ack field.  If true, one of the listeners _must_ call event.Reply()
	to send a reply to the sender.  

	Event types are determined by the message generator, the process sending
	the http request to this process, and are _not_ controlled by this package.
	Same goes for the payload map.  The keys are up to the message generator.

	The user programme may specify an optional data item (probably a pointer to struct,
	but it can be anything) when an event registration is made.  This data item
	is then included when the event is sent to the listener allowing the listener
	to avoid having to depend on global data whenever possible. To support this, 
	the struct passed to a listener for an event is actually of tyep *Envelope
	which is stuffed with the even and data item.

	with this using a closure, but I'm not taking the time to go down that path until
	other more important things are implemented.)

	We assume that the body contains one complete json struct which might contain
	several messages.

	This is invoked as a goroutine by the http environment and when this returns the 
	session to the requestor is closed. So, we must ensure that we block until all
	output has been sent to the session before we return.  We do this by creating a 
	channel and we wait on a single message on that channel.  The channel is passed in 
	the datablock. Once we have the message, then we return.
